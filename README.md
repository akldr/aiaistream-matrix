# aiaistream-matrix / aiai.stream

This repository contains a minimal Next.js scaffold and an initial "matrix effect" page.

Quick start (local development):

```
cd /app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server listens on port `3000`.

Docker notes: the supplied `Dockerfile` uses `/app` as the working directory; mount your code and map port `3000` to access the app from your host.

Project purpose: matrix effect page and Next.js demo.
